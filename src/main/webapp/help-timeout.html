    <p>
        Apply a timeout in minutes (0 to 10080) of waiting for SSC to finish processing artifacts to avoid hanging build.
        If empty, there will be no timeout and the build will continue to poll indefinitely.
        Notice SCA and upload build have succeeded, this timeout applies only to checking status beyond that.
    </p>
